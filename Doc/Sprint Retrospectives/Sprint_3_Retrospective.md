## Objective:
The purpose of this retrospective is to reflect on Sprint 3, identify what went well, what didn’t go well, and agree on improvement actions for future sprints.

## What Went Well:
1. **Issue #15**: Successfully implemented pre-programmed drive commands for sending a frog on a mission.
2. **Issue #24**: Information logging in an SQLite database using JDBC was completed on time.
3. **Issue #25**: Toggle status and radar functionalities with buttons in the UI were successfully implemented.
4. **Issue #26**: Ensured new operations finish uncompleted ones without conflicts.
5. **Issue #27**: Achieved relatively accurate collision detection.
6. **Issue #28**: Cleared repetitive log messages from the terminal efficiently.
7. **Issue #30**: Displayed location of the frog, radar points, and destination point on the ground control map.
8. **Issue #31**: Optimized hyperparameters for better accuracy in the obstacle avoidance algorithm.
9. **Issue #32**: Stored used mission commands in the database in ground control.
10. **Issue #34**: Ensured the source code is readable and elegant.
11. **Issue #33**: Added the feature to ground control map that allows to export previously saved collision points from the database and show them on the map.
12. **Issue #37**: Created a video with voice-over demonstrating all important features.

## What Didn’t Go Well:
1. Some minor coordination issues leading to slightly delayed integration of certain features.
2. A few bugs identified late in the sprint required additional time to fix, slightly affecting the planned timeline.

## Improvement Actions:
1. Improve coordination between team members by scheduling regular check-ins.
2. Enhance early testing protocols to identify and address bugs earlier in the sprint.
3. Document any impediments and discuss them promptly during daily stand-ups to prevent delays.

## Lessons Learned:
- Early identification and resolution of potential conflicts in operations can save significant time and effort.
- Regular and clear communication is key to keeping the team aligned and on track.
- Ensuring that all team members have a clear understanding of their tasks and deadlines can improve overall efficiency and reduce delays.

## Follow-up Items:
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the improvement actions implemented in this sprint.

## Feedback and Suggestions:
- Team members appreciated the clear division of tasks and the support provided by peers.
- Suggest setting up more detailed guidelines for code readability and elegance to maintain consistency across the project.
- Consider allocating specific time slots for bug fixing to minimize disruptions to the overall workflow.
