| Test Case | Status            | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| TC 1.1    | Success           | All 3 windows open when the Main.java in Ground Control is run.                                                                                                                                                          |
| TC 2.1    | Success           | The Frog drives if a point on the map is chosen. It changes its direction if another point is chosen. The stop button stops the frog completely while any of the direction buttons change its direction correctly. Frog’s position trail obstacles and the destination point are correctly displayed on the map. |
| TC 2.2    | Partially Fail    | The Frog successfully changes the angle towards the destination and starts driving in its direction. It avoids minor obstacles on its way. If the Frog is on the same plane as the mission’s destinations the buttons make it drive to the correct spot. In case when there is a long path with complex obstacles the frog can get stuck in a loop and needs the use of manual commands to find a way around. |
| TC 2.3    | Success           | The terminal application sends commands correctly. The buttons to show or toggle radar and status also work. The exporting features output a message in the terminal and save the data to both database and CSV files.   |
| TC 3.1    | Success           | The Radar Map in Pilot shows all of the obstacles and the position of the Frog together with its angle in all of the steps of the test case.                                                                             |
| TC 3.2    | Partially Success | The Frog calculates the path in a straight line correctly. The Frog can avoid some obstacles but cannot avoid the more complex ones. The Frog prevents collisions most of the time.                                      |
